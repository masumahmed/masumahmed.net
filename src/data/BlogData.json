            "Github pages doesn't support URL routing for single page applications out of the box. This means that if you have a react app that uses react-router-dom to handle routing, you'll run into issues when you try to navigate to a route that isn't the root route. For example, if you have a route like `https://masumahmed.github.io/my-react-app/about`, you'll get a 404 error because github pages doesn't know how to handle that route.",
